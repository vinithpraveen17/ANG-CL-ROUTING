/**
 * This array contains all of the routes. Every route constitutes of a 'path' and a component which is used as a
 * 'page' - in a real application, components are actually hierarchically organized between pages and components,
 * with potentially multiple layers of components organized by their size.
 *
 * Notice that the path for the home component is '**'. This is a wildcard, meaning, 'any path'. So, going to a random
 * url on localhost:4200 will lead the user back to home. Typically, this would be used as a '404 page not found' type
 * of page. It's also important that this route is last, as Angular picks the first matching route.
 *
 * If you would like to look into how to also prevent users from accessing off-limits routes, look into route guards.
 * Route guards ensure that some condition must be met for users to access some route.
 *
 * TODO: add a route to 'profile', where the ProfileComponent is displayed. Be sure that the component is properly
 * imported, and that you link to the 'profile' route within the navbar component.
